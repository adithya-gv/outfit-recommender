## Introduction
Clothing shopping is a frequent occurrence, yet it remains a difficult and personal decision. Given our history of shopping and the characteristics of clothing items, we believe that automation and machine learning have the power to boost our decision making. There are many technologies targeting the fashion industry, usually leveraging data about customer habits and product appearances to make smart recommendations. 


### Background
Recommendation systems using visual, linguistic, or tabular data are a well-researched area. The popular approach is image-centric. This entails incorporating color, shape, and other visual cues to recommend either similar clothing or complementary pieces of fashion to a given product via Neural Networks [1,2]. Another popular technique utilizes NLP (Natural Language Processing) to help identify, cluster, and recommend clothing based on the names and descriptions of various products [3]. Other sources have worked with multi-label classification for clothing or data from professional stylists to better recommend specific clothing fashion to customers [4], but these diverge from our main focus.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset we plan to use is the H&M clothing purchase history dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/overview). The dataset has over 1 million logged clothing transactions, each attributed to a given ID representing a distinct person. The dataset also has metadata for clothing and images of each clothing item.

## Problem Statement

### Motivation
The motivation of our project is to bring recommendation system algorithms to an area of shopping that is highly personal and varied: clothes shopping. A secondary motivation was to go beyond simple analysis of purchasing data and use data intrinsic to the clothing and users to provide recommendations that target the user's specific features.

### Our Problems

Our problem is twofold. 
1. Measure the similarity between two arbitrary pieces of clothing and use this measurement to construct groupings of similar clothings. 
2. Construct a recommender system that will recommend clothing based on a user's purchase history. 

## Intended Methods
Each of the two subproblems within our overall problem has distinct approaches.

### Clothing Similarity
We plan to measure clothing similarity by applying a clustering algorithm over the features of each clothing item. We plan to apply a variety of clustering algorithms, ranging from K-Means to DBSCAN, to see which captures the shape of the data the best.

### Recommender System
To create the clothing recommender system, we plan to test a variety of popular approaches. The two front-runners for our recommender system so far are an artificial neural network, and a support vector machine. 

## Potential Results
For the clustering part of the project, it is likely that clothing with similar colors will be grouped. This is the most obvious way for the algorithm to perform. We can shift the focus away from color by converting images to grayscale so that we can see groupings based on clothing type, such as shirt/pants/shorts. The recommendation system should be able to take in a customer's purchase history of clothing and recommend items for them to purchase based on similarity with prior purchases and potential matches.
