# Outfit Recommender
Group 40's CS 4641 Project: a clothing recommendation system.
Project by: Jaxon Isenberg, Rishabh Jain, Rahi Kotadia, Adithya Vasudev, and Vivek Vijaykumar

### Introduction
Clothing shopping is something we do in our everyday lives, and yet it still remains a very difficult and personal decision whenever we go shop. However, with the way we shop, our history of shopping, and the similarities and differences between the clothing items themselves, this problem seems ripe for automation and machine learning to provide suggestions and alter the way we shop. 

### Background

### Dataset Overview
The dataset we plan to use is the H&M clothing purchase history dataset. The dataset has both text data of over 1 million logged clothing transactions, each attributed to a given ID representing a distinct person. The dataset also has metadata of the clothes, as well as metadata about the clothes, and images of each clothing item.

### Problem Statement
Our problem is twofold. 
1. Measure the similarity between two arbitrary pieces of clothing and use this measurement to construct groupings of similar clothings. 
2. Construct a recommender system that will recommend clothing based on their purchase history. 

### Intended Methods
Each of the two subproblems within our overall problem has distinct approaches.

##### Clothing Similarity
We plan to measure clothing similarity by applying a clustering algorithm over the features of each clothing item. We plan to apply a variety of clustering algorithms, ranging from K-Means to DBSCAN, to see which captures the shape of the data the best.

##### Recommender System
To create the clothing recommender system, we plan to test a variety of popular approaches. The two front-runners for our recommender system so far are an artificial neural network, and a support vector machine.
